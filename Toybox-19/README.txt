## 🎮 GVA Toyboxes — Interactive Journey (v1.0)

This repo contains Toyboxes 1–9 of the GVA interactive series — a gamified onboarding experience that builds narrative, XP, and player alignment across multiple micro-missions.

---

### ✅ Completed

- **Toyboxes 1–9** are fully functional and XP-consistent
- UX includes drag-and-drop, click reveals, modals, and forked choices
- XP system is tracked from 0 → 45 across the journey
- All assets are structured under `/assets/`

---

### 🎯 Current Endpoint (Toybox 9)

**Toybox 9** is a fork point:
- Players match each faction to its mission
- After correct matches, they must choose one path to continue
- Buttons redirect to:
  - `Toybox-10A/index.html` → Gamers Guild
  - `Toybox-10B/index.html` → Bud Brigade
  - `Toybox-10C/index.html` → Crypto Crew
  - `Toybox-10D/index.html` → Defiant Disruptors

---

### ⏭️ Next Steps

- Build Toyboxes **10A–10D** (faction-specific branches)
- Maintain XP flow and visual consistency
- Expand each branch into its own loop or lesson before reconverging later
